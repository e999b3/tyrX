# tyrX

**tyrX** is purpose-built for Autodesk Revit, starting with version 2025, seamlessly adapting to the transition to the .NET 8.0 framework introduced in this release. By dynamically targeting the specified `RevitVersion`, tyrX ensures compatibility with the appropriate framework and Revit API version, offering a streamlined and future-proof development experience. 

As the successor to **tyRevit**, **tyrX** retains its lightweight architecture, delivering an optimized external command solution for Revit. It remains dedicated to empowering users to craft custom workflows in Revit using **F#** programming. With robust support for **IntelliSense** in both Visual Studio Community and Visual Studio Code, tyrX enhances coding efficiency and simplifies the development process, making it an indispensable tool for Revit developers.

## Installation

To install **tyrX**, follow these straightforward steps:

### 1. Fork the Repository
Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.

### 2. Download the Project
You can either:
- Clone the repository using **GitHub Desktop**.
- Download the ZIP file directly from the repository and extract its contents.

### 3. Open the Project
- Open the unzipped folder with **Visual Studio Code** or load the solution file in **Visual Studio**.

### 4. Check RevitVersion and Compile
Depending on your Revit version, change the constant **RevitVersion** in the .fsproj file.

When compiling, Visual Studio will choose the targeted Revit API version to reference. If the chosen Revit major version is prior to 2025, the constant **TargetFramework** will be set to **net48**, otherwise it will target **net8.0-windows**.

### 5. Edit the Add-in Path
Modify the `tyrX.addin` file to point to the correct path of the built assembly `rX.dll`.

Change the highlighted line `<Assembly>...</Assembly>` to your own assembly path.

### 6. Copy the Add-in File
Copy the `tyrX.addin` file to the appropriate Revit add-in directory:

- **For current user**: `%appdata%\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\<RevitMajorVersion>`
- **For all users**: `%programdata%\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\<RevitMajorVersion>`

### 7. Launch Revit
Start **Revit** according to your version, and you are ready to go!


## Usage

Once loaded into the Revit environment, the core application of **tyrX** will search for classes that implement the `IExternalCommand` interface within the compiled `rX.dll` assembly. These classes will then be loaded and recognized as add-ins within Revit.

### Pre-compiled F# Scripts
In the root folder, you will find two F# scripts:
- `DevCommandCompiler.fs`
- `SelectedCommandCompiler.fs`

These scripts are set to be compiled into the assembly and can be accessed in Revit under:

**Tab**: `Add-Ins`  
**Panel**: `External`  
**Drop-down button**: `External Tools`

### Workflow

My preferred workflow when programming with F# for Revit is an iterative **try-and-error** approach. This involves making frequent changes to the code and testing them quickly. The most efficient way to do this is to **just save** my work-in-progress code and recompile it **only** by clicking the command button to run it. In fact, I use keyboard shortcuts to run my code, avoiding the time wasted searching for the right button to click. Once I'm satisfied with the code, or if I want to experiment with alternative solutions without losing my progress, I save a copy of the current code for comparison and further development.

This is where the two compiler scripts come into play.

- **Develop Command Compiler**: The `DevCommandCompiler.fs` script is designed to compile the `cmd/develop.fs` file, enabling you to focus on problem-solving without distractions.
- **Selected Command Compiler**: This command offers a drop-down list of all F# scripts located in the `cmd` folder, allowing you to select and execute any script easily. Once youâ€™re done with `develop.fs`, simply duplicate it, give it a meaningful name, and keep it available for future use.

### Key Benefits
- **No Revit Restarts Needed**: There is no need to restart your Revit session! You can modify and test your scripts in the `cmd` folder as often as needed.
- **Accelerate Your Workflow**: This approach encourages experimenting with different solutions, ensuring a fast and effective Revit coding experience.

Enjoy exploring and refining your Revit coding workflow!
